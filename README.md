# Databases Lab 2

1. Go to repl.it.
1. Cleate a new repl
1. Select import from git repository.
1. Enter the following URL to import this repo.
```
https://github.com/holliebaker/databases-lab-2-starter
```
1. Once it's imported you'll be placed in a bash shell (not an sqlite database). Run `sqlite3` to run the sqlite program.
1. Once you're in, type the following to run the code
```
.read main.sql
```
1. Enjoy! 🎉️

### Note

The green Run button at the top doesn't work - if anybody figures out how to get this working like it does in an SQLite repl project, please let me know :)
